# problem 1

\*This dataset contains 15 variables including origin, year, month, day,
hour, temp, dewo, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
pressure, visib,and time_hour:

``` r
library (moderndive)
data ("early_january_weather")
```

\*There are 358 rows and 15 columns in this dataset:

``` r
nrow (early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol (early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

\*The mean temperature is 39.58212:

``` r
mean (early_january_weather $ temp)
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

\*Make a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x):

``` r
library (tidyverse)
```

``` r

```

``` r
ggsave (' scatter_plot.pdf', height=4, width=4)
```

As the time goes on from January 1 st to Januray 14, temperature goes
through zigzag rise. There is a big drop in temperature after January
14. There is a slight increase in humidity from 40 to 100 between Jan 01
to Jan14 but not so obvious.

\#Problem 2

- Create a data frame comprised of:

  - a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
  - a character vector of length 10
  - a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
example_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = samp > 0,
  vec_character= c("one","one","one","one","one","one","one","one","one","one"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("level 1", "level 1", "level 1", "level 2", "level 2", "level 2", "level 3", "level 3", "level 3", "level 3"))
)
example_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##       samp vec_logical vec_character vec_factor
    ##      <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>         <fct>     
    ##  1 -1.20   FALSE       one           level 1   
    ##  2  0.364  TRUE        one           level 1   
    ##  3  0.715  TRUE        one           level 1   
    ##  4  0.188  TRUE        one           level 2   
    ##  5 -0.0679 FALSE       one           level 2   
    ##  6  1.43   TRUE        one           level 2   
    ##  7  0.199  TRUE        one           level 3   
    ##  8  0.164  TRUE        one           level 3   
    ##  9 -0.0145 FALSE       one           level 3   
    ## 10 -0.463  FALSE       one           level 3

\*Take the mean of each variable

``` r
mean (pull (example_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.1316528

``` r
mean (pull (example_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean (pull (example_df, vec_character))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(example_df, vec_character)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean (pull (example_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(example_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean of random sample is 0.1316528and the mean of logical vector is
0.6. The mean of charactor and factor vector didn’t work because
arguments are not numeric or logical.

\*Explicitly convert variables from one type to another

``` r
as.numeric (pull(example_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric (pull(example_df, vec_character))
as.numeric (pull(example_df, vec_factor))
```

Logical variables are converted to 1 and 0. Character variables cannot
be converted to numerical data so it displays NA. Factor variables are
converted to 1,2 and 3. Logical variables can be converted to numerical
variables, so I can take the mean of logical variables. Character
variables cannot be converted to numerical variables, so I cannot take
mean of character variables. Even though factor variables can be
converted to numerical variables, we cannot take the mean of factor
variables because those numbers can only represent the level. Therefore,
we cannot calculate the mean based on level of the dataset.
